	 <h1 align="CENTER">What Browser Do Undergraduates Use?</h1> 
	 <p align="CENTER">David M. Harrison<br>Department of Physics<br>University
		of Toronto<br><a href="mailto:harrison@physics.utoronto.ca">mailto:harrison@physics.utoronto.ca</a><br><br>November,
		2001</p> 
	 <p>I put a logger in the UPSCALE main page
		<a href="http://www.upscale.utoronto.ca/">http://www.upscale.utoronto.ca/</a>
		that records which browser was used to access the page. We logged for 7 days
		from Monday October 29 to Monday November 5, 2001.</p> 
	 <p>It is reasonable to assume that the vast majority of these accesses were
		by Physics undergraduates. Note that if a student accesses another UPSCALE page
		directly, such as the PHY138Y home page
		<a href="http://www.upscale.utoronto.ca/PHY138Y.html">http://www.upscale.utoronto.ca/PHY138Y.html</a>,
		this was not logged. Also, except for the main UPSCALE server Faraday we do not
		have information on which of the accesses were via "public" machines such as in
		the Information Commons, the Nortel lab, etc. and which were from student-owned
		platforms, and we don't know how many different students these figures
		correspond to.</p>
